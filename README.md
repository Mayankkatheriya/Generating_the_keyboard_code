## Explaination:

Your code creates a webpage that allows users to explore keyboard key presses. Here's a summary in 8-10 lines:

`HTML`:

* The HTML sets up a webpage with a container displaying a message "Press any Keyboard Key."
* It includes placeholders for displaying the pressed key and its corresponding key code.

`CSS`:

* The CSS defines the styling and layout of the webpage, including fonts, colors, and responsive design.
* It ensures the content is centered on the page and uses a gradient background.

`JavaScript`:

* The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the webpage.
* It listens for keyboard keydown events and displays the pressed key and its key code.
* An audio sound is played when a key is pressed, providing user feedback.

In summary, this webpage allows users to experiment with keyboard key presses and displays the pressed key along with its key code in an attractive and responsive design.
